### 🧠 About Me

I’m a systems-minded engineer who loves building technology that actually *does something useful*. My background is a mix of hands-on IT work, network architecture, and deep curiosity about how AI and automation can make infrastructure smarter.

I’ve spent **over 5 years working as a Help Desk Technician** at a university, solving real problems for real people — everything from network outages and endpoint failures to complex enterprise support tickets. That experience shaped the way I approach engineering: practical first, scalable second, and always with users in mind.

I hold a degree in **Cybersecurity Analytics & Operations from Penn State Greater Allegheny**, which gave me a strong foundation in security principles, network design, and risk management — skills I now use daily as I branch deeper into systems automation and machine learning.

💡 *Fun fact:* I love projects that start small and grow into something meaningful — whether that’s a new RL model, a home-lab cluster, or a neighborhood tech initiative.
